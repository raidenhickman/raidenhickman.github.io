      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; text-decoration: underline;">Education History</h1>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">I graduated from Shailer Park State High School in 2023. Since then, I've become an undergraduate at Griffith Universitys' Bachelor of Computer Science. Detailed here are notable achievements and classes from my education.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="margin-right: 50vw">Descriptions of some assessments are included, though links to the questions and responses themselves can't be due to Griffith University policy.</p>

          <h2>1011ICT - Applied Computing</h2>
          <p>Applied Computing taught me about SQL and Database Management Systems, which gave me some of the fundamental skills for database administration. These included advanced database structuring using normalisation and denormalisation techniques, use of SQL to create and host databases online, and team management.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="border: transparent">
          <h2>1007ICT - Computer Systems and Cybersecurity</h2>
          <p>This class focused on the fundamentals of how computers and basic networking functions under the hood, at the binary level and at more abstract levels.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Skills taught in this class include abstract electrical engineering, networking, abstraction, encryption, and boolean logic, all of which are extremely useful when programming with low-level languages.</p>

          <h2>1004ICT - Professional Practice in IT</h2>
          <p>Professional Practice in IT was a course designed to improve my soft skills in the IT world - workplace interactions, team dynamics, and leadership. All of these are, of course, vital skills to be a professional.</p>
        </li>
        <li style="border: transparent">
          <h2>1017SCG Foundation Mathematics and 1013ICT Mathematics for Computer Science</h2>
          <p>Together, these classes taught me Calculus, Probability, Statistics, and Algebra. Furthermore, they developed my use of the C programming language to solve problems relating to these topics.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This class involved one of the more interesting assessments - creating user-friendly C programs that can perform calculus and algebra efficiently. Altogether, the four programs I created performed sums & derivatives of polynomials, statistics, and a variety of matrix operations.</p>
        </li>
        <li style="border: transparent">
          <h2>High School</h2>
          <p>I possess a Certificate 2 in Engineering Pathways (MEM20413) and a Certificate 3 in Information and Digital Media (ICT30120). I received a High Distinction - First in Cohort award for the second certificate.</p>
          <br>
          <p>These certificates required I learn to perform standard diagnostic tests, provide ICT advice to clients, create ICT user documentation, and maintain and repair software and equipment, among other things.</p>
