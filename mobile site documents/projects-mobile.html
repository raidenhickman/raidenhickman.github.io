			<h2>This Website</h2>
			<p>This website was a way to replace the paper resume I had before. This way, it's memorable, easier to store, and extremely easy to update and maintain - which I will continue to do into the forseeable future.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I learnt HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Though the latter is not included in depth here), how to adjust a design to all devices correctly, and how to properly use and cite open-source projects.</p>

			<h2>Weather Tracker API</h2>
			<br>
			<p>The project, linked <a href="https://github.com/raidenhickman/Weather-API">here</a>, is a website which queries a weather API - openweathermap.org - for a location you can enter. The weather data for the area is then displayed automatically - including temperature, wind speed, and an icon based on the sky at the time.</p>

			<br>
			<p>Attached above is a screenshot of the website in action, after entering Brisbane, QLD, Australia as the location and Celsius as the measurement.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This project taught me about how to query APIs, use virtual environments, create and utilise .env files, and how to handle security protocols with sensitive information like API keys in public or open source projects while also ensuring they are as useable as possible to the end user.</p>

			<h2>Markov Chain Text Generation</h2>
			<p>One of my most recent projects, for which the GitHub files are <a href="https://github.com/raidenhickman/Markov-Chain-Text-Generator">here</a>, is a Markov chain algorithm, which breaks down input text to a list of which words come after which sets of other words most often. This has a variety of applications, as demonstrated in the sample program file.</p>
			<br>
			<img src="../images/Markov Example.png" style="width:80vw">
			<br>
			<p>Included above is a sample output for a sentence completion algorithm, with four classic books as input (listed in the GitHub readme file).</p>
			<br>
			<p>This project taught me more about the fundamentals of AI and autocomplete algorithms and maintaining flexibility while optimising; the same base code was used for both included sample programs, and could be used for most Markov chain related applications with little alteration..</p>

			<h2>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</h2>
			<p>This book and its companion course on Udemy were quite useful for developing my interest in programming. The certificate of completion is linked <a href="https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-0b9c5c09-7aa8-42b0-9941-6dbfef1e44f4/">here</a>.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The practical skills I learnt involve image recognition - i.e identifying objects on the screen - along with task automation.</p>
