      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; text-decoration: underline;">Education History</h1>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">I graduated from Shailer Park State High School in 2023. Since then, I've become an undergraduate at Griffith Universitys' Bachelor of Computer Science. Detailed here are notable achievements, classes, and assessments that will be most relevant to my career.</p>
      <br>

          <h2>1811ICT - Programming Principles</h2>
          <p>Programming Principles involved the fundamentals of Python programming. Included is file manipulation, basic Object Oriented Programming, more advanced problem solving and debugging techniques, and proper practice for researching issues whilst programming.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li style="border: transparent">
          <h2>1011ICT - Applied Computing</h2>
          <p>Applied Computing taught me about SQL and Database Management Systems. Skills here included advanced database structuring using normalisation and denormalisation techniques, use of SQL to create and host databases online, and team management.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li style="border: transparent">
          <h2>1007ICT - Computer Systems and Cybersecurity</h2>
          <p>This class focused on the fundamentals of how computers and basic networking functions under the hood, at the binary level and at more abstract levels. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The major assignment for this course was the design of a circuitboard for stocktaking - stock levels are increased and decreased based on the months selected (represented by a 4 bit value - 0000 for January, 0001 for February, and so on) and then stored in a memory circuit.</p>

          <img src="images/profile picture.png">
          <p>Pictured are the circuitboard diagrams. Skills taught in this class include abstract electrical engineering, networking, and boolean logic, all of which are extremely useful when programming with low-level languages such as C due to the advanced control over data locations.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li style="border: transparent">
          <h2>1808ICT - Discrete Structures</h2>
          <p>This class was a deep dive on Discrete Mathematics - set and graph theory (and their relevant algorithms) up to mathematical proofs. These topics are directly designed to cover the most vital mathematics and logic for programming.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li style="border: transparent">
          <h2>1004ICT - Professional Practice in IT</h2>
          <p>Professional Practice in IT was a course designed to improve my soft skills in the IT world - workplace interactions, team dynamics, and leadership. Assessments included prediction of the future evolution of the field and a career plan.</p>
        </li>

          <h2>1017SCG Foundation Mathematics and 1013ICT Mathematics for Computer Science</h2>
          <p>Together, these classes taught me Calculus, Probability, Statistics, and Algebra. Furthermore, they developed my use of the C programming language to solve problems relating to these topics.</p>

          <p>Attached are my submissions for each of 4 questions. Together, these programs performed; sums & derivatives of polynomials, basic statistical analysis, and various applications relating to matrices including multiplication.</p>
          <br>
          <p>These classes developed all of the fundamental mathematical skills for a wide variety of applications, honed my critical thinking skills, and introduced me to C and low-level programming languages like it.</p>
        </li>
        <li style="border: transparent">
          <h2>Current Classes</h2>
          <p>The classes I am currently undertaking in Trimester 1 of 2025 are; 1118ICT Introduction to Cybersecurity, 2800ICT Object Oriented Programming, 2801ICT Computing Algorithms, and 3809ICT Ethical Hacking.</p>
        </li>
        <li style="border: transparent">
          <h2>High School</h2>
          <p>I possess a Certificate 2 in Engineering Pathways (MEM20413) and a Certificate 3 in Information and Digital Media (ICT30120). I received a High Distinction - First in Cohort award for the second certificate.</p>
          <br>
          <p>These certificates required I learn to perform standard diagnostic tests, provide ICT advice to clients, create ICT user documentation, maintain and repair ICT software and equipment, and work with other organisations IP and privacy policies along with basic engineering skills and teamwork.</p>
