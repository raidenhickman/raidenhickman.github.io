      <p style="margin-top: 0;">I graduated from Shailer Park State High School in 2023. Since then, I've become an undergraduate at Griffith Universitys' Bachelor of Computer Science. Detailed here are notable achievements, classes, and assessments that will be most relevant to my career.</p>

          <h2>Markov Chain Text Generation</h2>
          <p>One of my most recent projects, for which the GitHub files are </p>
          <a href="https://github.com/raidenhickman/Markov-Chain-Text-Generator">here</a>
          <p>, is a program which breaks down any input text into statistics for how often certain words come after other sets of words. I used this technology to attempt to guess the word that follows a phrase the user types in. Also included is a nonsense text generator that attempts to match the patterns of the training data. However, be warned; only 4 books were used as training data, so the results won't be very accurate.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This project taught me more about the fundamentals of AI and autocomplete programs, maximising the efficiency of a program in a short time period, and maintaining the flexibility of a program; the same base code was used as a base for both included sample programs.</p>

          <h2>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</h2>
          <p>Having read the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart & completed the 50 lesson companion course in 2022, this was foundational to the path I ended up taking. The certificate of completion is linked </p>
          <a href="https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-0b9c5c09-7aa8-42b0-9941-6dbfef1e44f4/">here</a>
          <p>.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The practical skills I learnt involve image recognition - i.e identifying objects on the screen - along with task automation.</p>

          <h2>This Website</h2>
          <p>Having listed most of the interesting features of this project on the Home page, this section will be short.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I learnt HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JavaScript not included in depth here), basic principles of graphic design and User Experience, adjusting my design to all devices correctly, and how to properly use and cite open-source projects.</p>

          <h2>Weather Tracker API</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The project, linked </p>
          <a href="https://github.com/raidenhickman/Weather-API">here</a>
          <p>, is a website which queries a weather API - openweathermap.org - for a location you can enter. The weather data for the area is then displayed automatically.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This project taught me about how to query APIs, use virtual environments, create and utilise .env files, and how to handle security protocols with sensitive information like API keys in public or open source projects while also ensuring they are as useable as possible to the end user.</p>
