          <h2>This Website</h2>
          <p>This website was a way to replace the paper resume I had before - this way, my resume is accessible easily to anyone, anywhere, with no downloads or external programs, and I can update it automatically for all of them - which I will continue to do for the forseeable future.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I learnt HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JavaScript not included in depth here), basic principles of graphic design and User Experience, adjusting my design to all devices correctly, and how to properly use and cite open-source projects.</p>

          <h2>Weather Tracker API</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The project, linked <a href="https://github.com/raidenhickman/Weather-API">here</a>, is a website which queries a weather API - openweathermap.org - for a location you can enter. The weather data for the area is then displayed automatically.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Attached above is a screenshot of the website in action, after entering Brisbane, QLD, Australia as the location and Celsius as the measurement.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This project taught me about how to query APIs, use virtual environments, create and utilise .env files, and how to handle security protocols with sensitive information like API keys in public or open source projects while also ensuring they are as useable as possible to the end user.</p>

          <h2>Markov Chain Text Generation</h2>
          <p>One of my most recent projects, for which the GitHub files are <a href="https://github.com/raidenhickman/Markov-Chain-Text-Generator">here</a>, is a program which breaks down any input text into statistics for how often certain words come after other sets of words. This is used for nonsense text generation and, more interestingly, attempting to complete sentences entered by the user.</p>
          <br>
          <img src="images/Markov Example.png" style="width:40vw">
          <br>
          <p>Included above is a sample output for the sentence completion algorithm, with four classic books as input (listed in the GitHub readme file). Higher accuracy comes with more training data, of course.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This project taught me more about the fundamentals of AI and autocomplete programs, maximising the efficiency of a program in a short time period, and maintaining the flexibility of a program; the same base code was used as a base for both included sample programs.</p>

          <h2>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</h2>
          <p>Having read the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart & completed the 50 lesson companion course in 2022, this was foundational to the path I ended up taking. The certificate of completion is linked <a href="https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-0b9c5c09-7aa8-42b0-9941-6dbfef1e44f4/">here</a>. I'm continuing to use Udemy to learn to this day! Currently, I'm partway into Tim Buchalka's Java Masterclass on track to become Java certified before the end of this University trimester.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The practical skills I learnt involve image recognition - i.e identifying objects on the screen - along with task automation.</p>
