            <h2>Created without AI tools</h2>
            <p>I created this website entirely by hand to learn better techniques for HTML and CSS - specifically, more responsive design that will work on as many devices and browsers as possible. AI is a tool, not a teacher.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Hosted on GitHub</h2>
            <p>You can view the project files <a href="https://github.com/raidenhickman/raidenhickman.github.io/tree/main">here</a>! This includes all code, images, and commit history used in the creation of the site; it proves that I know how to use the proprietary tools required for most projects.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Other Tools Utilised</h2>
            <p>Speaking of tools, here's the complete list of tools I utilised to create the website - and most of the projects listed on the other pages.</p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Visual Studio Code</dt>
              <dd>- I prefer to create my projects in VSCode as it's open source, easily modifiable (with an extensive library of extensions), and used by many professionals - this teaches me many of the conventions I need to know in the future through immersion rather than just the theory.</dd>
              <dt>GitHub Desktop</dt>
              <dd>- Part of the purpose of this project was so that I could learn to use GitHub correctly due to how important it is to know how to use. GitHub Desktop combines all the important tools into one convenient package.</dd>
              <dt>Stack Overflow & Google</dt>
              <dd>Searching for answers to your problems is a vital part of the debugging process, so it's important that I know proper practices for searching those websites quickly and efficiently, along with the ability to decipher & apply answers that aren't perfectly tailored to my every question. Asking for help isn't cheating!</dd>
            </dl>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>The Design Process</h2>
            <p>While you can look at the GitHub page to see my work over time, that's not the whole picture - included here are some images of the original designs I used to prototype this website. (Images to be inserted) Further, with my dad acting as project manager, this was structured to approximate how a real project might work in the workplace.</p>
