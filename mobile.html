			  <li>
				<h2>Created without AI tools</h2>
				<p>I created this website entirely by hand to learn better techniques for HTML and CSS - specifically, more responsive design that will work on as many devices and browsers as possible. AI is a tool, not a teacher.</p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<h2>Hosted on GitHub</h2>
				<p>You can view the project files <a href="https://github.com/raidenhickman/raidenhickman.github.io/tree/main">here</a>! This includes all code, images, and commit history used in the creation of the site; it proves that I know how to use the proprietary tools required for most projects.</p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<h2>Other Tools Utilised</h2>
				<p>Speaking of tools, here's the complete list of tools I utilised to create the website - and most of the projects listed on the other pages.</p>
				<dl>
				  <dt>Visual Studio Code</dt>
				  <dd>- I prefer to create my projects in VSCode as it's open source, easily modifiable (with an extensive library of extensions), and used by many professionals - this teaches me many of the conventions I need to know in the future through immersion rather than just the theory.</dd>
				  <dt>GitHub Desktop</dt>
				  <dd>- Part of the purpose of this project was so that I could learn to use GitHub correctly due to how important it is to know how to use. GitHub Desktop combines all the important tools into one convenient package.</dd>
				  <dt>Stack Overflow & Google</dt>
				  <dd>Searching for answers to your problems is a vital part of the debugging process, so it's important that I know proper practices for searching those websites quickly and efficiently, along with the ability to decipher & apply answers that aren't perfectly tailored to my every question. Asking for help isn't cheating!</dd>
				</dl>
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<h2>The Design Process</h2>
				<p>While you can look at the GitHub page to see my work over time, that's not the whole picture - included here are some images of the original designs I used to prototype this website. (Images to be inserted) Further, with my dad acting as project manager, this was structured to approximate how a real project might work in the workplace.</p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<h2>Works on Mobile</h2>
				<p>This website was designed to also display correctly on mobile devices by automatically switching the page. Most of the elements are the same across pages to prove that their design is properly adaptive to all situations - they don't just look good on one device or browser. Of course, I can't test everything; if something doesn't work on your device, feel free to contact me! All I need is a screenshot and your device model and I'll have it fixed ASAP!</p>
